# RISC-V
32-bit RISC-V processor developed using Verilog HDL. This project serves as a practical platform for learning computer architecture and processor design based on the RV32I base instruction set. It follows a clean, modular, and extensible design, making it ideal for academic, research, and prototyping purposes.
